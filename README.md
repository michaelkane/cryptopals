Cryptopals
==========

This is just me trying to learn some Haskell and basic cryptography by working
through the [matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com).

You proably don't want to be reading this stuff.  I'm sure I'm doing a lot
badly.  Anyway, do the challenges yourself â€“ they're good fun and a great excuse
to pick up a new language.
